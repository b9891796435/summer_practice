## First Week: The Data Transportation Among Vue apps.
Commonly, we use Vuex for same level apps, props for father to child and custom event for child to father. 
At first week I'd like to start with props.
To use props, you need to declear it in app invoking and declearation.

## Second Week: DOM Event and Custom Event 
Custom event is to define your own event. To learn this part, I'd like to start with the study of DOM event.
Then it's the time for the emiting and listening of custom event.
