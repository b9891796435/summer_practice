# Summer Practice Project
This project is for weekly submission of study outcome as a SIPC115 member. Init by vuecli.

## First week:The Data Transportation Among Vue apps.
Commonly, we use Vuex for same level apps, props for father to child and custom event for child to father. 
At first week I'd like to start with props.
To use props, you need to declear it in app invoking and declearation.
